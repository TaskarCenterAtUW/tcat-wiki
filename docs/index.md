## Welcome to the TCAT Wiki!

The [Taskar Center for Accessible Technology](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/) (TCAT), housed by the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) (CSE) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) (the UW), develops, translates, and deploys open-source, universally accessible technologies with a focus on pedestrian networks.

This wiki serves as a documentation hub for TCAT-related projects.

### Projects

**[OpenSidewalks](opensidewalks/index.md)** — An open data standard for pedestrian networks.

**[TDEI](tdei/index.md)** — The Transportation Data Exchange Initiative: infrastructure for collecting, storing, maintaining, and sharing transportation data.

**[OS-CONNECT](os-connect/index.md)** — A connected pedestrian network dataset covering 320+ jurisdictions in Washington State.

**[Workspaces](workspaces/index.md)** — A platform for creating, editing, and maintaining OSW datasets, using the web-based [Rapid](rapid/index.md) editor or the [AVIV ScoutRoute](aviv-scoutroute/index.md) mobile app.

**[AccessMap](accessmap/index.md)** — Trip planning and customizable accessibility-focused multimodal routing.

**[Walksheds](accessmap/index.md)** — Tool for analyzing pedestrian infrastructure and access to amenities.
