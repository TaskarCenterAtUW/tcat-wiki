## Welcome to the TCAT Wiki!

The [Taskar Center for Accessible Technology](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/) (TCAT), housed by the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) (CSE) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) (the UW), develops, translates, and deploys open-source, universally accessible technologies with a focus on pedestrian networks.

This wiki serves as a documentation hub for TCAT-related projects.
