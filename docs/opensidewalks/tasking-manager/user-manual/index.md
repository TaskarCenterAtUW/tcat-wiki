## Core Concepts

### Tasking Manager Group Types

- **User:** An OSM user that has logged into the Tasking Manager at least once
    - Ex: *UW Amy Bordenave*
- **Project:** A small area of the world that has been defined as needing mapping. Created and maintained by an organization manager
    - Ex: *#1234 - Downtown, Seattle, WA, US: Pedestrian Infrastructure | #OpenSidewalks*
- **Categories:** 'Labels' manually assigned to a project by the project creator based on its focus, e.g. 'disaster response' or 'pedestrian infrastructure'
- **Campaigns:** Groups of projects which are closely related (e.g. Myanmar Earthquake 2025 campaign - which contains dozens of projects related to that particular disaster response)
- **Teams:** Groups of OSM users created by organization managers and given varying access permissions to projects (e.g. permission to validate a project)
- **Organizations:** Groups of projects and teams created by organization managers. E.g. Organization MSF, which has hundreds of MSF projects and has also created the MSF Validation Team
