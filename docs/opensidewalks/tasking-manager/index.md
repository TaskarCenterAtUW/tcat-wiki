## OSW on the OSM US Tasking Manager

The [OpenStreetMap US Tasking Manager](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/) is a [Tasking Manager](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tasking_Manager) instance for coordinating contributions to OSM and is open to all OSM users.

TCAT operates the [OpenSidewalks organization](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/organisations/8/) on the OSM US Tasking Manager and coordinates both community mapping projects and TCAT-directed organized editing following [OpenSidewalks in OpenStreetMap](../schema/osw-in-osm.md) guidelines.

Additional details about this organized editing activity can be found on the [Organised Editing/Activities/OpenSidewalks](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/OpenSidewalks) page on the OSM Wiki.
