[OpenSidewalks](../index.md) is an open data project by the [Taskar Center for Accessible Technology](../../index.md) at the University of Washington in Seattle. The project heavily relies on the OpenStreetMap infrastructure, mapping standards, and volunteer community.

## Welcome

[OpenSidewalks](../index.md) (OSW) is a project that engages wide audiences in the important work of collaborative open source mapping of pedestrian pathways and related features. Our mission is to create a tooling ecosystem that supports the consistent, standardized collection of data about the pedestrian environment. This open and shared data can then be used to enable pedestrian routing applications, inform infrastructure planning, and advocate for improved walkability, accessibility, and quality of life for all.

This learning resource contains material to help you create accessible pedestrian pathways data that is shared in the global, open source [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) database. As we continue to engage with more cities in our mission to improve and scale the documentation of pedestrian pathways, we maintain this self-paced training resource to enable the participation of mapping contributors.

Because the OpenStreetMap community is constantly evolving, mapping guidance is always changing with it. Consequently, we recommend that the use of this guide is combined with consultation with the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/) as well as the local OSM community.

Thank you for your interest in OpenSidewalks. Together, we can work towards creating inclusive and accessible data about the pedestrian environment that benefits communities worldwide!
