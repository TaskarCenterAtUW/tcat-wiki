## OpenSidewalks

OpenSidewalks ([OSW](https://sidewalks.washington.edu/)) is an initiative led by the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT) at the University of Washington (UW).

OpenSidewalks seeks to provide a specification that is not only compatible with OpenStreetMap but is a comprehensive and accessibility-forward specification for mapping sidewalks and related pedestrian infrastructure features.

### [OpenSidewalks Schema](schema/index.md)

The [OpenSidewalks Schema](https://github.com/OpenSidewalks/OpenSidewalks-Schema) is an open pedestrian transportation infrastructure network data standard for describing and sharing pedestrian network and pedestrian network-adjacent data. The OpenSidewalks Schema promotes an explicit network (graph) model that represents a traversable and graph-analyzable network of pedestrian paths such as sidewalks, street crossings, some streets, and other paths, as well as metadata representing potential barriers.

The OpenSidewalks Schema draws from and is intended to be largely compatible with OpenStreetMap data, though it is possible to create OpenSidewalks Schema data not derived from OpenStreetMap.

### [OSW on the OSM US Tasking Manager](tasking-manager/index.md)

The [OpenStreetMap US Tasking Manager](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/) is a [Tasking Manager](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tasking_Manager) instance for coordinating contributions to OSM and is open to all OSM users.

TCAT operates the [OpenSidewalks organization](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/organisations/8/) on the OSM US Tasking Manager and coordinates both community mapping projects and TCAT-directed organized editing following [OpenSidewalks in OpenStreetMap](schema\osw-in-osm.md) guidelines.

Additional details about this organized editing activity can be found on the [Organised Editing/Activities/OpenSidewalks](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/OpenSidewalks) page on the OSM Wiki.
