# OpenSidewalks

OpenSidewalks ([OSW](https://sidewalks.washington.edu/)) is an initiative led by the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT) at the University of Washington (UW).

OpenSidewalks seeks to provide a specification that is not only compatible with OpenStreetMap but is a comprehensive and accessibility-forward specification for mapping sidewalks and related pedestrian infrastructure features.

## [OpenSidewalks Schema](schema/index.md)

The [OpenSidewalks Schema](https://github.com/OpenSidewalks/OpenSidewalks-Schema) is a proposed open pedestrian transportation network data standard which draws from and is intended to be largely compatible with OpenStreetMap data.

## [OSW on the OSM US Tasking Manager](tasking-manager/index.md)

The [OpenStreetMap US Tasking Manager](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/) is a [Tasking Manager](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tasking_Manager) instance for coordinating contributions to OSM and is open to all OSM users.

TCAT operates the [OpenSidewalks organization](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/organisations/8/) on the OSM US Tasking Manager and coordinates both community mapping projects and TCAT-directed organized editing following [OpenSidewalks in OpenStreetMap](schema\osw-in-osm.md) guidelines.

Additional details about this organized editing activity can be found on the [Organised Editing/Activities/OpenSidewalks](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/OpenSidewalks) page on the OSM Wiki.
