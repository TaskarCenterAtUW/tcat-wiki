## Installation

This guide provides platform-specific instructions for installing AVIV ScoutRoute on Android and iOS devices.

_For a list of all guides on the TCAT Wiki, refer to the [Guides List](../../guides-list/index.md)._

---

### TDEI Registration Options

There are two ways to register for a TDEI account:

**Standard Registration:** Visit [portal.tdei.us/register](https://portal.tdei.us/register) and enter the requested information. After registering, contact your project's point of contact to be added to a project group.

For additional details, refer to the [TDEI Portal > User Manual > Account Registration](../../tdei/portal/user-manual/account-registration.md) page if needed.

**Referral Code Registration:** If you received a referral code (e.g., `portal.tdei.us/register?code=AA-BBB-CCCC-DD`) or a QR code, use that link to register. This automatically adds you to the appropriate project group so that the right workspaces show up - no additional steps needed.

!!! tip "Event Participants"

    If you're participating in a **mapping event**, you likely received a QR code to scan or a referral link.

    Use that link to register for the fastest, most streamlined setup experience.
