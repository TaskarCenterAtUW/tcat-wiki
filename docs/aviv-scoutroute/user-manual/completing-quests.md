_For a list of all guides on the TCAT Wiki, refer to the [Guides List](../../guides-list/index.md)._

### Viewing Available Quests

When you open a workspace, the map displays available quests as icons on the map. Each icon represents a data collection task for a specific feature.

<!-- === "Android" -->

<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Map with quest icons visible | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/android/map-with-quests-dark.png#only-dark{ width="300" } -->
<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Map with quest icons visible | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/android/map-with-quests-light.png#only-light{ width="300" } -->

<!-- === "iOS (Apple)" -->

!!! tip

    Quest icons stack when you're zoomed out. **Zoom in** to see all available quests in a dense area.

### Selecting a Quest

1. Tap on a quest icon on the map

2. A panel appears, showing:
    - The feature type
    - Questions about that element
    - Descriptions or instructions
    - The answer options

3. The map highlights the feature the quest is asking about

<!-- === "Android" -->

### Answering a Quest

The way you answer depends on the quest type. Common input methods include:

| Input Type               | How to Answer                                             |
|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Single Choice**        | Tap one option; it will be highlighted with a pink border |
| **Multiple Choice**      | Tap one or more options; selected items show pink borders |
| **Numeric Entry**        | Use the on-screen keypad to enter a number                |
| **Free-Form Text Entry** | Type your response (max 255 characters)                   |

For detailed information about each quest type, see [Quest Types](quest-types.md).

### Tips for Accurate Data Collection

#### Observe in Person

For the most accurate data:

- **Be at the location** when answering quests about physical features
- **Look at the actual feature** rather than relying on map imagery alone
- **Take your time** to ensure accurate observations

#### When to Use "Unknown"

Some quests include an "Unknown" or "Can't determine" option. Use this when:

- You cannot physically access or see the feature
- The feature is obscured (construction, parked vehicles, etc.)
- You're unsure about which answer option is correct

!!! warning

    Submitting inaccurate data degrades the quality of the dataset. When in doubt, use "Unknown" or skip that question rather than guessing.

#### Handling Ambiguous Situations

If a feature doesn't clearly match any of the provided options:

1. Choose the **closest match** available
2. If there's a free-form text field, add clarifying notes
3. If truly ambiguous, consider using "Unknown" or skipping the quest

---

### Skipping Quests

You don't have to complete every quest you open! To skip a quest:

1. Tap the Close (++x++) icon in the upper right corner
2. The quest remains on the map for later (or for another user)

You can also hide individual quests you want to skip temporarily - see [App Settings - Hidden Quests](app-settings.md#hidden-quests).

---

### Undoing Submitted Answers

Made a mistake? You can undo recent submissions:

1. Select the **Undo button** in the bottom left
2. Select the quest answer that you want to revert
3. Select **Undo**

For more detailed instructions, see [Undo Changes](map-interface.md#undo-changes).

---

### Group Quest Selection

The quest multi-select feature makes it easier to apply the same answers to multiple similar features at once, saving time when features share characteristics.

**How to use:**

1. The map shows multiple selectable features of the same type
2. Tap each feature you want to include - selected features show a **purple checkmark**
3. Tap a selected feature again to deselect it
4. Tap **"Answer Quests"** to proceed
5. Answer the questions (your responses apply to all selected features)
6. Tap **Submit** when ready

<!-- === "Android" -->

<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Group quest selection example | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/android/quest-group-selection-dark.png#only-dark{ width="300" } -->
<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Group quest selection example | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/android/quest-group-selection-light.png#only-light{ width="300" } -->

<!-- === "iOS (Apple)" -->

<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Group quest selection example | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/ios/quest-group-selection-light.png#only-light{ width="300" } -->

**Example scenario:**

You're at an intersection where all eight curb ramps have the same characteristics. Instead of answering eight separate quests, you can:

1. Select all eight curb features
2. Answer the questions once
3. Submit - all eight quests are completed with the same data

!!! warning

    Only use group quest selection when you're confident that all selected features share the same characteristics. If features differ, answer them individually.
