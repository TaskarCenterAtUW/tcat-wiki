## Getting Started

This guide walks you through your first steps after installing AVIV ScoutRoute, including logging in, selecting a workspace, understanding basic concepts, and completing your first quest.

_For a list of all guides on the TCAT Wiki, refer to the [Guides List](../../guides-list/index.md)._

---

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- Installed AVIV ScoutRoute on your device (see [Installation](installation.md))
- Registered for a TDEI account at [portal.tdei.us](https://portal.tdei.us/)
- Been added to a project group by your project's point of contact

!!! info "Joined via Referral Code?"

    If you registered using a referral code (e.g., `portal.tdei.us/register?code=AA-BBB-CCCC-DD`) or a QR code, you've already been automatically added to the appropriate project group. The relevant workspace should open automatically or appear in the workspace list after logging in.

---

### Logging In

1. **Open** the AVIV ScoutRoute app on your mobile device

2. **Enter** your TDEI account credentials (email and password)

3. Select **Login**

<!-- === "Android" -->

!!! tip

    If available on your device, you can choose to use biometric authentication for faster login after your first sign-in.

---

### Selecting a Workspace

After logging in, you'll see a list of available workspaces. A **workspace** is a geographic area with data that your project team is collecting information about.

1. Review the list of available workspaces

2. Select the workspace you want to work in

3. The map will load, centered on your location

<!-- === "Android" -->

<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Workspace selection screen | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/android/workspace-selection-dark.png#only-dark{ width="300" } -->
<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Workspace selection screen | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/android/workspace-selection-light.png#only-light{ width="300" } -->

<!-- === "iOS (Apple)" -->

<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Workspace selection screen | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/ios/workspace-selection-dark.png#only-dark{ width="300" } -->
<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Workspace selection screen | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/ios/workspace-selection-light.png#only-light{ width="300" } -->

!!! note

    If you don't see any workspaces, contact your project's point of contact to ensure you've been added to the correct project group.

### Understanding the Interface

Once you've selected a workspace, you'll see the main map interface:

<!-- === "Android" -->

<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Main map interface | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/android/map-interface-dark.png#only-dark{ width="300" } -->
<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Main map interface | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/android/map-interface-light.png#only-light{ width="300" } -->

<!-- === "iOS (Apple)" -->

<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Main map interface | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/ios/map-interface-dark.png#only-dark{ width="300" } -->
<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Main map interface | ../../resources/images/aviv-scoutroute/ios/map-interface-light.png#only-light{ width="300" } -->

| Element                | Description                                                            |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Map View**           | The central area showing the workspace and background                  |
| **Quest Icons**        | Icons on the map representing available quests (data collection tasks) |
| **Screen Reader Mode** | List-based quest view instead of map                                   |
| **Interface**          | Additional buttons and menus                                           |

For detailed information on each interface feature, refer to the [Map Interface](map-interface) page.

### What is a Quest?

A **quest** is a small data collection task prompting you to provide information about a specific feature. Quests appear as dots (at low zoom) or pins (when zoomed in) on the map.

Common examples of types of features you'll be asked about include:

| Quest Type   | Icon                                             | Description                          |
|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| **Sidewalk** | Path icon with grey/blue areas                   | Questions about sidewalk segments    |
| **Crossing** | White pedestrian in crosswalk on blue background | Questions about pedestrian crossings |
| **Curb**     | White wheelchair at curb on blue background      | Questions about curbs and ramps      |
