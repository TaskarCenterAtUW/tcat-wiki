### About AVIV ScoutRoute

[AVIV ScoutRoute](../index.md) is a mobile application developed by the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology at the University of Washington. It empowers communities to collect and contribute data about pedestrian access and sidewalk conditions.

AVIV ScoutRoute is based on [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete). Users see an overhead map view with icons representing "quests" - simple surveys for missing pedestrian infrastructure data.
