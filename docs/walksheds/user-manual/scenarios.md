## Scenarios

This section explains how to save walksheds as named scenarios and use them to compare results across different configurations or datasets.

_For a list of all guides on the TCAT Wiki, refer to the [Guides List](../../guides-list/index.md)._

### What Is a Scenario?

A **scenario** is a saved snapshot of a walkshed, including its origin point, travel budget, preference settings, and resulting network coverage. Saving multiple scenarios allows you to overlay and compare walksheds on the same map, for example to visualize the difference in coverage between two mobility profiles, two different datasets, or two different departure times.

### Saving a Scenario

After a walkshed is generated, select **Save Scenario** from the action pop-up at the bottom of the screen. Enter a name in the text input box and confirm to save the current walkshed as a named scenario.

### Accessing and Managing Scenarios

Saved scenarios are listed in the **Edits tab** (pencil icon) in the left sidebar, in the section below any attribute edits you have made. From there, you can review saved scenarios or delete them.

Selecting the checkbox next to a saved scenario will make that scenario visible on the map view.
