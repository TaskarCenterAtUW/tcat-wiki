### About Walksheds

The [TDEI Walksheds tool](https://walkshed.tdei.us) calculates pedestrian walkshed areas around a specified origin point. 

A **walkshed** is the region reachable by pedestrians (on foot or by mobility device) within a given travel time or cost budget, given the characteristics of the surrounding pedestrian network: sidewalks, crossings, slopes, and barriers such as curbs and stairs.

Unlike a simple distance radius, a walkshed reflects real-world travel conditions. Two points equidistant from an origin may have very different costs to reach depending on slope, raised curbs or stairs, or whether the route requires crossing a busy street. The result is a realistic map of accessible space from your chosen origin point.

A TDEI account is required to sign in. You can register for one at [portal.tdei.us/register](https://portal.tdei.us/register).
