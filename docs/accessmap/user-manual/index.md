### About AccessMap

[AccessMap](https://accessmap.app) is a free, web-based pedestrian trip planner developed by the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT) at the University of Washington. Unlike general-purpose navigation apps, AccessMap is designed to support the full diversity of how pedestrians travel — accounting for mobility aids, vision, and physical ability — and to give users meaningful control over their route.

AccessMap provides:

- **Pedestrian-specific routing** — routes on sidewalks, crossings, and footways rather than roadways
- **Elevation awareness** — color-coded visualization of incline grades along paths
- **Barrier and curb ramp information** — identification and optional avoidance of raised curbs and stairs
- **Customizable mobility profiles** — tailored routing for manual wheelchair users, powered wheelchair users, support cane users, and blind/low-vision users, as well as a fully customizable profile
- **Screen reader support** — step-by-step directions with landmark-based alerts for non-visual navigation
- **Feedback** — the ability to leave comments on map features to help improve the underlying data

AccessMap is powered by [OpenSidewalks](../../opensidewalks/index.md) and [OpenStreetMap](https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/) data.
