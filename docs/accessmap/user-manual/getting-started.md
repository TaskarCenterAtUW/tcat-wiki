### Accessing AccessMap

AccessMap is a web application, so **no download or installation is required**. It runs directly in your browser on any device, including phone, tablet, or desktop.

1. Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

2. Navigate to [AccessMap.app](https://accessmap.app)

### Selecting a Region

AccessMap is available in a number of regions across Washington State and beyond. When you first open AccessMap, the map will be centered on the default region. To switch to a different region:

1. Select the **region name** displayed in a box at the top of the left sidebar (e.g., "Seattle, WA")

2. A **Regions** dialog will appear with a filterable list of all available regions

3. Scroll through or type in the **filter** field to narrow the list

4. Select the region you want to explore

!!! info "Coverage"

    AccessMap coverage depends on available pedestrian network data. Coverage outside Washington State varies by region and depends on local data availability.

### Taking the Tour

If you are new to AccessMap, select the **Take a tour** button (top right of the map) for a quick guided walkthrough of the interface. The tour opens a series of popups that highlight key features and provide an introduction to planning your first route.
