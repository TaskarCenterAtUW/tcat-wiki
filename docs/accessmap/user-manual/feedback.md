## Leaving Feedback

This section explains how to leave comments on map features to report observations and help improve the data.

_For a list of all guides on the TCAT Wiki, refer to the [Guides List](../../guides-list/index.md)._

---

### Overview

AccessMap allows you to **share feedback** about routing directions and about specific features in and around the pedestrian network, such as sidewalks, crossings, curb ramps, or landmarks.

Feedback helps TCAT and community contributors identify issues in the underlying pedestrian data and prioritize improvements.

---

### Feature Feedback

To report an issue with a specific map feature (such as a sidewalk, crossing, or curb ramp), tap or click on or near the feature to open a [details popup](interface.md#inspecting-a-feature), then select **Share Feedback**. This opens the **Share feedback about this feature** form.

Select one or more issue types by checking the relevant boxes:

| Checkbox                                  | Use When                                                        |
|:------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **The feature is located somewhere else** | The feature exists but is mapped in the wrong location          |
| **Inaccurate information**                | An attribute is incorrect (e.g., wrong surface type or incline) |
| **Add something that's missing**          | A real-world feature is not represented in the data             |

Optionally, add details in the **Comments** text field, then select **Submit** to send your feedback (or **Cancel** to dismiss).

### Step Feedback

To report an issue with a specific segment of a planned route, open the [Directions panel](navigation.md#directions-panel) and select the **Share Feedback** link on any direction card. This opens the **Share feedback about this step** form.

Select one or more issue types by checking the relevant boxes:

| Checkbox                                | Use When                                                         |
|:----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inaccurate GPS**                      | Your GPS position does not align with the route shown on the map |
| **This part of the path is inaccurate** | The described path segment does not match real-world conditions  |
| **Add something that's missing**        | Relevant information about the step is absent                    |

Optionally, add details in the **Comments** text field, then select **Submit** to send your feedback (or **Cancel** to dismiss).

!!! tip "Writing Effective Comments"

    Be concise and specific. Good examples:

    - _"This crossing does not have markings"_
    - _"Surface is gravel, not concrete"_
    - _"There is a newly installed curb ramp at this corner"_
    - _"There is not a bench here"_
    - _"The path here is blocked by a tree"_
