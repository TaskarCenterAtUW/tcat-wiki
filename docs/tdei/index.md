# TDEI

The **Transportation Data Exchange Initiative** (TDEI) is focused on developing a shared, standardized framework for transportation data, enabling seamless integration across mobility systems. This project aims to provide mobility benefits for travelers and service providers by collecting and providing infrastructure to sustainably support open data about sidewalks, transit paths, and on-demand transit services. Through supporting the collection, maintenance, and exchange of detailed data on pedestrian pathways, transit networks, and on-demand services, TDEI lays the groundwork for more effective transportation planning and innovation.

Reliable data is essential for decision-making. TDEI addresses gaps in transportation data through a three-pronged approach:

- **Enhance data standards** to include information relevant to all travelers and transit stakeholders.
- **Provide tools and data infrastructure** reducing barriers for data stewards to collect, vet, maintain and use traveler-centric transportation data at scale.
- **Demonstrate our work** through **pilot data collections** with private and public partners, and **demonstration projects** that make use of our data.

With the support of the **Transportation Data Exchange Initiative** (TDEI), the OpenSidewalks project and its suite of tools—including AccessMap—provide detailed insights into sidewalk connectivity and pedestrian networks. These resources equip individuals, civic organizations, and government agencies with the data needed to support informed mobility planning and decision-making.

_TDEI is a project sponsored by the [ITS4US Deployment Program](https://www.its.dot.gov/its4us/index.htm), focused on improving frameworks for transportation services and infrastructure. By developing open-source data collection tools, digital infrastructure, and governance models, TDEI enables seamless public-private data exchange and interoperability._

## User Registration and Access

All TDEI users register through the same process and receive an API key and access credentials. Users are differentiated by their assigned roles and permissions.

API keys are used to retrieve data from TDEI. Access credentials are used to log into the portal, retrieve or regenerate API keys, and upload data.

## Roles

### Data Consumer

A data consumer is a user who will read data from the TDEI. Any person can register with the TDEI to be a data consumer.

### Point of Contact

Each Project Group must have a designated Point of Contact (PoC). They have the authority to approve access for data generators for that Project Group. The purpose of the PoC is to ensure that staff from the related agency, company, or group with the proper authority are approving access for data generators.

### Data Generator

A data generator is a user who will contribute data to the TDEI.

#### Flex Data Generator

The `flex-data-generator` role allows a user to create GTFS Flex data.

#### Pathways Data Generator

The `pathways-data-generator` role allows a user to create GTFS Pathways data.

#### OpenSidewalks Data Generator

The `osw-data-generator` role allows a user to upload OpenSidewalks data.
