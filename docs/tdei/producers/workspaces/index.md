# Workspaces

Workspaces Platform

## Editors

There are multiple ways of submitting edits to data in an open workspace.

### [AVIV ScoutRoute]()

AVIV ScoutRoute (formerly [GoInfoGame](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/goinfogame-app/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/OpenSidewalks/GoInfoGame))) is a volunteerism app based on [StreetComplete](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete) that leverages the power of crowdsourcing to gather critical pedestrian and accessibility information.

### [Rapid]()

Rapid is an extended version of the OpenStreetMap iD editor. A modified version of Rapid is embedded in [Workspaces]() and can be used to edit data in open workspaces.
