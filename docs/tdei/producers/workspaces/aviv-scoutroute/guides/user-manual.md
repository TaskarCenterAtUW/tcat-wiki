## Introduction

This document enables users to try out AVIV ScoutRoute (in conjunction with a workspace) where one can answer quests. After reading this document, users should be able to install AVIV ScoutRoute, as well as view and complete quests in the app.

AVIV ScoutRoute is a volunteerism game for crowdsourcing pedestrian and accessibility information, and is an adaptation of the [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete) project. Users see an overhead map view, with easy-to-select icons representing ‘quests’. Quests are simple surveys for missing labels in an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreemap.org/)\-style workspace; for example, a given quest may ask the user to say whether the sidewalk they are using is made of concrete, asphalt, or another material.

Note that AVIV ScoutRoute was rebranded from the original "GoInfoGame" / "GiG" branding, and some materials have not yet been updated to reflect this.
