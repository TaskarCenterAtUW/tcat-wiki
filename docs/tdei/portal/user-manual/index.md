### About the TDEI Portal

The [TDEI Portal](https://portal.tdei.us/) is the web interface for the **Transportation Data Exchange Initiative** (TDEI). It provides registered users with access to TDEI datasets, processing jobs, and project management tools.

Through the portal, users can:

- **Register and manage their account** — create an account, obtain an API key, and reset their password
- **View and manage project groups** — see the project groups they belong to and access their settings
- **Manage services** — project managers can create and manage data services linked to their project group
- **Manage members and roles** — project managers can add members and assign roles within their project group
- **Browse and download datasets** — view both project-specific and publicly released datasets available in the TDEI system
- **Handle feedback** — view and resolve feedback items and related statistics
- **Create and monitor jobs** — submit processing jobs (validation, conversion, quality metrics, and more) and track their status
