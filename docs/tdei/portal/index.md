### About the TDEI Portal

The [TDEI Portal](https://portal.tdei.us/) provides registered users with access to TDEI datasets and project management tools. It serves as the primary interface for interacting with the TDEI platform, whether browsing public data as a consumer or contributing and managing data as a producer.

Through the TDEI Portal, users can register and manage their account, view and manage project groups, members and roles, services, and feedback, submit and monitor processing jobs, and browse and download datasets.

### Roles

All TDEI users register through the same process via the portal and receive an API key and access credentials. Users are differentiated by their assigned roles and permissions.

#### Data Consumer

A data consumer is a user who reads data from the TDEI. Anyone can register with the TDEI to be a data consumer. In addition to the TDEI Portal web UI, API keys are used to retrieve TDEI datasets.

#### Point of Contact

Each project group has at least one designated Point of Contact (`poc` role). They act as a project group manager and have the ability to configure project group settings, members, and datasets.

#### Data Producer

A data producer is a user who contributes data to the TDEI. In addition to the standard `member` role, the following data producer roles are available:

- **Flex Data Producer** (`flex-data-generator`) — publishes GTFS-Flex data
- **Pathways Data Producer** (`pathways-data-generator`) — publishes GTFS-Pathways data
- **OpenSidewalks Data Producer** (`osw-data-generator`) — publishes OpenSidewalks data
