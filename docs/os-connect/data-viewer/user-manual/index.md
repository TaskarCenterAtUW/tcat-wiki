### About the OS-CONNECT Data Viewer

The [OS-CONNECT Data Viewer](https://osconnect-viewer.tdei.us/) is a web-based map application for exploring the OS-CONNECT pedestrian network dataset. It visualizes sidewalks, crossings, footways, curbs, and traffic islands across Washington State, enabling planners, transportation professionals, and community members to inspect and understand the current state of pedestrian infrastructure data.

The Data Viewer displays vector tile data rendered on an interactive Leaflet map, with the ability to switch between raster and aerial imagery base maps, toggle data and boundary layers on and off, hover over features to view their attributes, search for specific dataset boundaries, inspect locations, view [QA/QC Reports](../../qa-qc/index.md), and report data issues.
