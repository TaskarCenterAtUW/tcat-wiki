### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Taskar Center

??? question "What is the Taskar Center?"

    [The Taskar Center for Accessible Technology](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/) (TCAT), housed by the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) (the UW), develops, translates, and deploys open source universally accessible technologies, with a focus on benefiting populations with motor limitations or speech impairment.

??? question "Where can I find more information about TCAT?"

    Additional information can be found on the [TCAT website](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/abouttcat/).

#### TDEI

??? question "What is the TDEI?"

    The Transportation Data Exchange Initiative (TDEI) is aimed at developing a unified, shared data framework to improve mobility equity, focusing on detailed data about pedestrian networks and travel environments and providing the essential groundwork for future innovations in urban mobility.

??? question "Where can I find more information about the TDEI?"

    Additional information can be found on the [TDEI website](https://transitequity.cs.washington.edu/tdei/) and the [TCAT website](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/tdei/).

#### OpenSidewalks

??? question "What is OpenSidewalks?"

    [OpenSidewalks](https://sidewalks.washington.edu/) (OSW) is an initiative led by the [Taskar Center for Accessible Technology](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/) (TCAT) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) (UW) which seeks to provide a specification that is not only compatible with OpenStreetMap but is a comprehensive and accessibility-forward specification for mapping sidewalks and related pedestrian infrastructure features.

??? question "Where can I find more information about OpenSidewalks?"

    Additional information can be found on the [OpenSidewalks](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/opensidewalks/) page.

??? question "How can I reach out to TCAT about OpenSidewalks?"

    Email: [OpenSidewalks Mailing List](mailto:OpenSidewalks@uw.edu)

#### OpenStreetMap

??? question "What is OpenStreetMap?"

    [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) is an openly licensed, freely editable geospatial database.

??? question "How is OpenStreetMap related to the TDEI/TCAT/OSW/OS-CONNECT/AccessMap/Walksheds?"

    The UW and related initiatives and projects are not "officially" associated with OpenStreetMap, but we are proud to be part of the OSM community, like many other organizations and companies, and we both use OpenStreetMap data in various ways and contribute data back to OpenStreetMap.

??? question "Where can I find more information about OSM?"

    Additional information can be found on the [OpenStreetMap website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) and the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/).

#### OS-CONNECT

??? question "What is OS-CONNECT?"

    OS-CONNECT is a Washington state-wide pedestrian infrastructure dataset in OSW v0.2 schema, covering 95% of the state's population as well as the densest population centers and transit facilities.

??? question "Where can I find more information about OS-CONNECT?"

    [2024_12_19 WA State Proviso last 24 Advisory Meeting](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1slDcNFMICPKfKsGjAIS603-ZhQ2-8PwlH95wja4ETdY/edit#slide=id.g2f93bdcef76_0_0) slides.

#### AccessMap

??? question "What is AccessMap?"

    AccessMap ([AccessMap.app](https://www.accessmap.app/)) is an accessibility-first, multimodal trip planner for non-drivers, bridging gaps by providing detailed information on pedestrian paths, transit stations, elevation changes, curb ramps, and more.

??? question "What is the process for adding a region to AccessMap?"

    If you'd like us to add a new region to AccessMap, we'd be delighted to hear from you! You can provide either a polygon outlining the region or an administrative boundary from OpenStreetMap (e.g., [Seattle](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/237385)).

    Next, we will assess the completeness, accuracy, and general validity of the pedestrian mapping for that region in OSM. If the mapping is reasonably accurate and potentially useful for AccessMap users, we would be happy to include it in the application!

??? question "Where can I find more information about AccessMap?"

    Additional information can be found on the [TDEI website](https://transitequity.cs.washington.edu/accessmap/) and [OpenSidewalks website](https://sidewalks.washington.edu/2024/06/03/accessmap/).

??? question "How can I reach out to TCAT about AccessMap?"

    Email: [AccessMap Help](mailto:help@accessmap.atlassian.net) (help@accessmap.atlassian.net)

#### Specialized Community-Led Impact Opportunity (SCLIO) Grants

??? question "What are SCLIOs?"

    The SCLIO (Specialized Community-Led Impact Opportunities) Grant mission is to empower communities to leverage the OS-CONNECT dataset to address pedestrian access, transportation equity, and infrastructure challenges. This grant program supports community-driven projects that foster collaboration, produce measurable and scalable outcomes, and create innovative solutions to improve accessibility and equity in transportation infrastructure.

??? question "Where can I find more information about SCLIOs?"

    Additional information can be found on the [SCLIO website](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/participate/sclio-grants/).

??? question "How can I reach out to TCAT about SCLIOs?"

    Email: [uwtcat@uw.edu](mailto:uwtcat@uw.edu)

#### Walksheds

??? question "What are Walksheds?"

    Walksheds are maps that describe the accessibility and connectivity of various locations through pathways near the location given certain accessibility constraints.

??? question "How do Walksheds work?"

    Walksheds uses a processing algorithm that calculates a "reachable tree" of accessible paths near a certain location.

??? question "How do I run Walksheds?"

    There are two ways to run Walksheds:

    - Through the Walksheds website ([walkshed.tdei.us](https://walkshed.tdei.us/)), ideal for quick results on accessibility conditions or finding features that can be updated.
    - A script in QGIS that calls the Walksheds API, ideal for customized profiles (sets of parameters) or generating high-quality maps.

??? question "What are the parameters of Walksheds?"

    - Street avoidance factor (1 = avoid streets, 0 = use streets)
    - Maximum uphill and downhill steepness (0 to 15%)
    - Avoid raised curbs and stairs (true or false)
    - Reverse walkshed (true or false)
    - Maximum cost (0 to 3600)

??? question "Where can Walksheds be run?"

    Currently, Walksheds can be run on data sets that cover the major towns and cities within Washington state.

??? question "What information can be gathered from Walksheds?"

    The length and reach of pathways given various accessibility constraints and the number of paths, crossings, curbs, and lowered curbs.

??? question "How can I reach out to TCAT about Walksheds?"
