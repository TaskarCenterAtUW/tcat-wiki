# AccessMap Guide

This page contains information about accessing and using AccessMap at the [Clark County Walk/Roll Event](index.md).

## What is AccessMap?

AccessMap is a free, web-based pedestrian trip planner developed by the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology at the University of Washington. Unlike typical navigation apps, AccessMap provides detailed information specifically designed for people with mobility challenges, those who are blind/low-vision, or have other accessibility needs, including:

- **Sidewalks and footpaths**: Mapped pedestrian networks with detailed attributes based on [OpenSidewalks](../../opensidewalks/index.md) data
- **Elevation changes**: Color-coded paths indicating steepness
- **Curb ramps and barriers**: Identification of obstacles like raised curbs and stairs
- **Customizable routing**: Routes tailored to your specific mobility preferences

1. Open your web browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) on any device

1. **Enable location services** on your device when prompted

2. **Follow the highlighted route** on the map

3. AccessMap will provide **step-by-step directions** as you move

4. The app includes details on tactile landmarks and other features useful for navigation

## Providing Feedback via Comments

AccessMap allows you to leave comments about barriers, issues, or observations along your route:

1. While viewing the map, **tap** on a location where you want to leave feedback

2. A popup will appear with details about the selected feature. **Navigate** to the "Leave feedback about this feature." text entry box.

3. **Describe** the issue or observation (e.g., "Broken pavement", "Missing curb ramp", "Temporary construction barrier")

4. "**Submit**" your comment

Your feedback helps improve the accuracy of the data for all users.

## Exploring Data Before the Event

We encourage participants to review the current sidewalk and pedestrian data for the route and surrounding area using the OSConnect Data Viewer:

[**OSConnect Data Viewer - Vancouver, WA**](https://osconnect-viewer.tdei.us/#map=15/45.64/-122.65)

This viewer displays the OS-CONNECT database - a standardized collection of sidewalk and pedestrian infrastructure data for Washington State. After the event, you can revisit this view to see the difference your contributions have made to the dataset.

## Differences Between AccessMap Comments and AVIV ScoutRoute Quests

| Feature      | AccessMap Comments                            | AVIV ScoutRoute Quests                               |
|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**  | Free-form notes about barriers or experiences | Structured data collection about specific features   |
| **Format**   | Text descriptions                             | Multiple choice, numeric entry, structured responses |
| **Use Case** | Reporting issues, sharing observations        | Adding detailed feature attributes                   |

Both types of feedback are valuable! Use AccessMap comments for general observations and AVIV ScoutRoute quests for detailed, structured data contribution.
