## Usage

This section covers the use of the AVIV ScoutRoute mobile application at the Clark County Walk/Roll Event.

### Select the Workspace

1. **Open** the AVIV ScoutRoute app on your mobile device

2. **Log in** using the email and password you registered with in [Step 1](#step-1-register).

3. On the home screen, you will see a list of workspaces. Select **"NDA Vancouver"**

    _Using VoiceOver, the screen will say "AVIV ScoutRoute: Pick the workspace you want to contribute to" with a list of workspaces._

    _Note: Because you registered using the event referral code, you have been automatically added to the correct project group (SCLIO Vancouver) and the correct workspace (NDA Vancouver) should be visible._

4. The app will now display available quests in the Vancouver, WA area!

### Understanding Quests

Quests in AVIV ScoutRoute are small pieces of information to gather about the built environment. Each quest type is represented by a circular icon on the map:

|             Icon              | Quest Type          | Description                                                 |
|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
|              Bus              | **Bus Stops**       | Quests about a bus stop location                            |
|   Pedestrian inside pathway   | **Sidewalks**       | Covers a stretch of the pedestrian sidepath along the road  |
| Pedestrian on marked crossing | **Crossings**       | Pertains to a crossing that intersects with vehicle traffic |
|         Traffic light         | **Intersections**   | Questions about a given intersection as a whole             |
|              Car              | **Driveway Points** | Location of a sidewalk-driveway intersection                |

**Tip:** Quest icons stack up to keep the map easy to see. Make sure you **zoom in** to see every available quest!

### Finding Quests On Location

When you are physically present at the event location:

1. Ensure location services are enabled on your device

2. The app will automatically show quests near your current location

3. Travel along the route and tap on quest icons as you encounter them

4. Answer the questions based on your direct observations of the environment

### Downloading Data for Remote Access

_Note: When opening the NDA Vancouver workspace from outside of Vancouver, WA, a message may pop up saying "Download error. Send an error report to the developer?" This is expected, as AVIV ScoutRoute is intended for use during on-the-ground, at-location surveys. Click "**Cancel**" and move the map to the Vancouver, WA area before continuing._

If you want to preview quests remotely (not on-location) or preload data (for example, on WiFi before beginning the walkabout, instead of using mobile data):

1. Open the app, log in, and select the **"NDA Vancouver"** workspace

2. Navigate the map to the Vancouver, WA area (from Clark College to Washington Street)

3. Select the **Menu** in the top bar

4. Select "**Download data here**"

5. The app will download all quest data for the visible area on your screen

### Completing a Quest

1. **Tap on a quest icon** to open the quest details

2. **Read the question** and observe the feature being asked about

3. **Provide your answer** using one of the following input types:
    - **Single Select**: Choose one answer that best represents your observation
    - **Numeric Entry**: Enter a number using the on-screen keypad (e.g., sidewalk width in inches)
    - **Multi-Select**: Select one or more applicable options
    - **Free Form Text**: Enter a brief text response

4. **Review your answer** to ensure accuracy

5. Tap "**Submit**" to send the information

Once submitted, the quest will disappear from the map.

### Hiding and Unhiding Elements

If you want to temporarily skip a quest:

1. Tap on the quest icon to open it

2. Select **"Hide this"** to remove it from the map temporarily

To restore hidden quests:

1. Open **Settings** > **Manage Quests**

2. View the **Hidden Elements** section

3. Tap **"Unhide All"** or select individual elements to restore

### Undoing Changes

If you made a mistake:
