## Overview

On January 19th, 2026, the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT) hosted **Mappy New Year 2026**, a virtual mapathon focused on improving pedestrian infrastructure data in Tacoma, WA. The event brought together mappers of all skill levels to contribute to the OpenStreetMap project through the OSM US Tasking Manager.

## Participation

- **8 external participants** joined TCAT staff for the event
- Mappers contributed to **[Project #1017 - Tacoma, WA, US: Pedestrian Infrastructure](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/projects/1017)**

- **Number of changes**: 1,961 map edits across 31 changesets
- **Footways mapped**: 18 miles total length
- **Crossings mapped**: 253 crossing edges
