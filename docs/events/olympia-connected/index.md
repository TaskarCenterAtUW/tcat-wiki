## Olympia, Connected

The **Olympia, Connected: Mapping for Mobility in OpenStreetMap** event is an in-person mapping event led by [MaptimeSEA](https://maptimesea.github.io/) in coordination with the [Taskar Center for Accessible Technology](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/) (TCAT) to focus on improving pedestrian infrastructure and accessibility data in **Olympia, WA**.

### Resources

#### Mapping Guide

Visit the [Mapping Guide](mapping-guide.md) for guidance on how to map pedestrian infrastructure for the Olympia, Connected event.

#### Validation Guide

Visit the [Validation Guide](validation-guide.md) for directions on how to validate mapped pedestrian infrastructure tasks in the OSM US Tasking Manager for the Olympia, Connected event.

### Project

We'll be mapping pedestrian infrastructure in Olympia, WA using the OSM US Tasking Manager:

**[#1083 - Olympia, WA, US: Pedestrian Infrastructure | #OpenSidewalks](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/projects/1083)**

### Event Details

#### Event Summary

Join us for a collaborative in-person mapping event where we'll work together to remotely map pedestrian infrastructure in Olympia, Washington, and contribute that data to OpenStreetMap! We'll gather in-person at Seattle University and use the browser-based Rapid editor to add sidewalks, crossings, curbs, and other features that impact pedestrian mobility, especially those who are blind/low-vision or people who are using wheelchairs, walkers, or other mobility devices.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the world's largest open-source map database, created by volunteers like you. The pedestrian data we map will support accessibility routing applications and research. This event is perfect for beginner and intermediate mappers, so whether you're completely new to OSM or already have some mapping experience, you'll contribute meaningful accessibility data that makes a real difference in people's everyday lives.

We'll use the Rapid editor, a user-friendly, web-based tool that runs right in your browser - no downloads or installations required! We'll work through tasks using a project on the OSM US Tasking Manager, allowing us to collaborate effectively and make sure we're covering the area with a coordinated, systematic approach. The Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT) at the University of Washington is co-hosting this event as part of our ongoing work to improve pedestrian accessibility data.

**Organizers:** [MaptimeSEA](https://maptimesea.github.io/), [TCAT](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/)

#### How to Prepare

**Create an OpenStreetMap Account:** If you don't already have one, please create a free OSM account on [openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) before the event. You'll need this to save your edits.

**Optional - Join the OSM US Tasking Manager:**

1. Log in to the OSM US Tasking Manager at [tasks.openstreetmap.us](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us) using your OSM account
2. Join the OpenSidewalks Mappers Team at [tasks.openstreetmap.us/teams/27/membership](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/teams/27/membership)

**No software installation required!** We'll be using the Rapid editor, which runs entirely in your web browser. Just bring your laptop with a modern browser and you're all set.

Don't worry if you can't complete the prep work - we'll help everyone get set up at the beginning of the event!

#### Who Should Attend

This event is designed primarily for beginner and intermediate mappers. Whether you're:

- Brand new to OpenStreetMap and want to learn how to contribute
- Have mapped a few things before and want to build your skills
- Curious about accessibility and urban planning
